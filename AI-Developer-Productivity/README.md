## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**:

   * Handled missing or invalid values
   * Standardized categorical responses

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   * Visualized frequency of AI usage, satisfaction, and perceived gains
   * Compared productivity by developer experience levels

3. **Insights Generation**:

   * Identified correlations and trends
   * Used bar plots, pie charts, and cross-tab visualizations

---

## 🏆 Key Insights

* Developers using AI tools daily reported significantly higher productivity.
* Most time savings came from **code suggestions** and **bug fixes**.
* Senior developers used AI for optimization, while juniors used it for learning and syntax.
* Common concerns included **code reliability**, **over-reliance**, and **data privacy**.
